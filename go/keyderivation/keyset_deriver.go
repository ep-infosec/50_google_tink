// KeysetDeriver is the interface used to derive new keysets based on an
// additional input, the salt.
//
// The salt is used to create the keyset using a pseudorandom function. More
// explicitly, implementations need to generate keysets which are secure even if
// the attacker is given the salt, plus access to an oracle which creates
// keysets for any salt the attacker requests, as long as it is not equal to the
// salt which the attacker attacks.
